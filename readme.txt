== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this work with my theme? =

Yes! Gambol Builder works with any properly coded WordPress theme. It integrates seamlessly with the block editor.

No, Gambol Builder extends the native WordPress block editor (Gutenberg) with additional blocks and features. It doesn't replace the editor.

No! Gambol Builder is built with performance as a top priority. Blocks are lightweight and CSS is loaded conditionally only when blocks are used.
